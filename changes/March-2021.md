# March-2021

## March-2-2021(v:1.0.0-Development)
- Updated Bundling Method: This version contains a major change to how the package handles bundling files. Previously this package used the older *@import* SCSS syntax for bundling files through out the package, this causes repeated code and increased package size. So we have now updated to the proper *@use* and *@forward* syntax that SCSS recommends. 
  - ALL SCSS files have been updated to this format.
