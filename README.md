# About

StageHands another handy framework :smile:

> **NOTE [UnStable]** : This project is currently still under development. Some features are either incomplete, may be changed or removed completely. This version is also currently **NOT** stable and has may issues/bugs, this should not but used in any production environment.

# Documentation 
The documentation for StageHands comes packaged with the project. 

To view the documentation files locally and have the links work properly, it is required you use some sort of local server and point the entry to the *StageHands/tests* directory then view the files from the port you have setup for your local server. Otherwise the document links will not work, so styling and moving from page to page internally will not work properly.

> **NOTE[Work In Progress]** : The documentation for this framework is currently a work in progress. That is that certain project related definitions or terms used may change or be removed. We understand this is one of the biggest inconveniences when it comes to learning a new framework 😔, but we are trying to provide meaningful terminology that can accurately describe what the framework is achieving without being to 'wordy'. Please if you have any recommendations, comments, or issues about this documentation please create an issue on this projects Github repo and it will be looked into and considered.


# Contributions
StageHands is currently not accepting external contributions at this point as the project is too early in development 😥. Buuuttt....
Before the initial release of the project we will have a community opener where we will see what everyone wants and what needs to be improved or dropped. Then we hope to move to a full initial launch were we will have a more stable, but probably less frequent update schedule. After that it will be the community's 🥳🎊🎉
